I am currently attending the Full Stack Engineering course at UCLA Extension and will be graduating this Sept of 2020. After graduation, I believe that my previous professional experience combined with the knowledge that I obtain from this course will allow me to make an immediate impact in my future positions. This course has given me the knowledge to work with technologies such as HTML, Javascript, jQuery, MySQL, MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, React, and a few more. I am very eager to continue my learning of engineering as this industry is always changing while contributing to an engineering team at a high level. </p></div>

I spoke to him in depth about it, and decided to do some research myself. As I continued to look into Software Development, the more I started to get hooked! I started to do free courses online which I got better and better over time, and in doing so I thought about really investing in myself to learn the industry. With steep prices, I hesitated a lot, but the more I thought about it I knew this was the industry I wanted to be in and make a long-time career out of it. I started attending the UCLA Extension Full Stack Engineering Course which unfortunately started at the beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic. But, sitting where I am at now, this may have been a blessing in disguise. Learning such a difficult skill online helped me to become more discipline, self-reliant, and persistent. I was able to work with real clients that we vetted ourselves and deliver products that I will forever be proud of. I graduate this September 2020, and I cannot wait to apply what I have learned in a company where I can contribute at a high level</p></div>

Going through my years living in LA, I decided to leave the Restaurant Industry and get into Tech World. For all those who have decided to pivot in their career, you definitely understand how hard it was for me to land a position at a tech company. Luckily, right before I left for the holidays I received my first offer from a company called LoopUp. In my position at LoopUp, I assisted in Sales Meetings, learned how to talk to C-Class Offiers and IT Directors, and, most importantly, learned how to fail....A LOT! Sales is no joke of a job and definitely teaches you how to be persistent and resilient in life.</p></div>

I grew up competitive. I played sports my whole life, won state twice and got a scholarship to continue my athletic career. Being competitive and being Number One was engrained in my DNA. So when I came across a company that pointed out the flaws and things that I needed to work on, I immediately became defensive. This was something that I worked on during my tenure at JOEY, and proudly still work on today. I believe it is important for everyone to accept and own the things that dont make them great, whatever they may be</p></div>

I did a couple of jobs that were just ehh, so i called up one of my buddies who was a shoe salesman at Nordstrom, or what they called a shoe dog. I got introduced to the hiring manager and started the following week at the Anniversary Sale. Here I learned what customer service really meant. I learned how to speak about items that I may have not had the most confidence speaking about. I had to think quick on my feet and maybe say "I do not know that answer, let me find out for you". I also learned how to interact with different personalities. You're not going to like everyone who you work with, or you even might have a customer that may be a little difficult at times, but its important to stay professional and treat everyone with respect no matter what</p></div>

I was always excited during basketball seasons as well when my travel teams would get to work concession stands in the stadium, because by halftime we were in the stands watching Nate Robinson and Brandon Roy tear up the Pac-10.

                                    <p>Soma Kitchen is a catering company located in Los Angeles. They had a website with no functionality. The owners wanted a website that allowed customers to engage with their products and services without having to reach out to them via phone or social media. We implemented several web APIs that allowed clients to order from their online menu, book private events, and pay for whatever products or services they have chose. We also utilized a MySQL database to keep track of previous, current, and inquiring customers.</p>

                                    <p>I created this workout tracker that utilizes a Mongo database to give a user the ability to track their workouts. The user will be able to vew previous workouts done, create new workouts they have just completed, and track their daily workouts with the combined weight and time through the stats page. </p>
